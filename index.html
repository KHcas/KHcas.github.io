                        A tropical cyclone is a generic term used by meteorologists to describe a rotating, organized system of clouds and thunderstorms that originates over tropical or subtropical waters and has closed, low-level circulation.

                        How do typhoons occur?

                    <div class="mainContent">
                        Typhoons don’t begin their lives as monsters. Instead, they begin as something called a tropical wave. A ​tropical wave​ is an atmospheric area of low pressure caused by rising warm air. These regularly form in the tropics, where the sun shines directly for most of the year. Because warm air can hold water better than cool air, low-pressure systems like tropical waves are warmer and wetter than the surrounding air, and they often appear carrying clouds.

The tropical waves that form typhoons tend to originate from a region meteorologists call the ​monsoon trough​, which is part of the Western Pacific's intertropical convergence zone. In this zone prevailing winds push westward from South America toward Asia and Australia.

                        What causes a typhoon?
                    </div>
                    <div class="mainContent">
                        Tropical waves don’t automatically give birth to typhoons, though. Other conditions have to be met for the tropical wave to become a full typhoon. First, there has to be a vertical temperature profile in the atmosphere that can cool warm air enough to cause ​convection​. This means that hot air, as it rises, is cooling enough to condense the water vapor it’s holding. As this happens, thunderstorms form.

As the tropical wave travels, it will encounter persistent converging winds in the lower and middle part of a region of the atmosphere called the ​troposphere​, which is between three and six miles from the Earth's surface. These winds are often associated with thunderstorms.

As the tropical waves encounter winds carrying thunderstorms, the heat and water vapor from those storms, along with heat from the ocean’s surface, can intensify the storm’s counterclockwise cyclonic rotation. This is called a ​mesoscale convective complex​, and the collision can produce a rotating column of air called a mesoscale convective vortex. This vortex is the beginning of a cyclone.
