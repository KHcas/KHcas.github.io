                            Typhoon Vicente was issued a T10 signal as it hit Hong Kong on July 24. Powerful winds tore up 8,800 trees, blocking main roads and halting MTR services. A station was even turned into a shelter for a night. Although 140 people were injured, fortunately, there were no recorded deaths.                    </div>

                                The first time in five years for the Observatory to issue T10, Typhoon Hato was a vicious storm to contend with. The storm was responsible for 10 fatalities in our neighbouring SAR of Macau, and major flooding in low-lying areas such as Lei Yue Mun, Tai O, and a Heng Fa Chuen car park, were completely submerged. Crazy strong winds smashed the windows of residential flats and over 5,300 fallen trees or other objects were reported.

                                On September 16, 2018, just a little over a year after Typhoon Hato hit Hong Kong, Typhoon Mangkhut marked the city's third Hurricane Signal number 10 since 1999. As one of the most powerful storms on record to hit the city, Typhoon Mangkhut ripped its way through Hong Kong causing extensive damage. 

                                More than 450 people were injured during the passage of Mangkhut, windows were smashed, buildings were rocked (some even crumbled), electricity supply to over 40,000 households in Hong Kong was interrupted, and it was reported that over 60,000 trees had fallen, the highest number on record according to the Observatory. Letâ€™s just say, Mangkhut is one to remember for the modern ages.                         </div>
